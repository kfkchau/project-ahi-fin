**Governance-First Frameworks for AI-Human Task Integrity**

---

## 🔍 What Is AHI FIN?
**AHI FIN** stands for **Artificial × Human Intelligence Framework for Integrity & Neutrality**.  
It is a governance-first initiative designed to operationalise trust and accountability in AI-human workflows.  

---

## ✅ Why AHI FIN?
Current AI governance frameworks:
- Focus on **principles and risk categories**, not **task-level allocation logic**.
- Lack **operational clarity** for human vs AI boundaries.
- Fail to provide **auditability and proportional oversight**.

**AHI FIN solves these gaps by:**
- Embedding governance logic into task design.
- Enabling **atomic decomposition** for transparency.
- Applying **risk-based oversight** proportional to reasoning complexity and data ambiguity.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This release is a **working draft** and will continue to evolve.  
While the structure and logic have been carefully designed, some sections may require refinement.  
Treat this version as **preliminary** and not yet production-certified.
